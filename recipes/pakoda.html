    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> <em> I have used finely sliced red onion, diced potatoes, cauliflower, and spinach. Apart from the onion, cut the other veggies small and to a similar size. You can also grate the potatoes if itâ€™s easier.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Herbs:</strong> <em>Fresh Coriander leaves (cilantro) are delicious in bhajis, so I always add them.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Gram flour:</strong> <em>also known as Chickpea Flour or Besan is naturally gluten-free. It has a nutty flavor and is easily available in major supermarkets</em></li>
        <li><strong>Rice flour:</strong> <em>is optional. I prefer to add rice flour for extra crispy vegetable pakoras</em></li>
        <li><strong>Spices:</strong> <em>In my pakodas, I like to add turmeric, chilli powder, cumin, coriander, and garam masala.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Chili:</strong> <em>I add a mix of both green chilli and Kashmiri chilli powder to the pakora batter. If you like it less spicy, leave out diced green chilli.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> <em>Only add as much as you need. There is no fixed proportion, but the mentioned quantity is for reference.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong> <em> Add salt to taste.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> <em>Adding some will bring out a lighter texture in the pakoras.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Preparing the Pakora Batter</h3>
        <li>
            Step 1: Place the veggies, coriander, gram flour (chickpea flour), rice flour, spices, and salt in a mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 2:Macerate with your hand so that the vegetables release a bit of water. If you have time, allow the vegetables mixture to rest about 30-40 minutes. It will release more water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 3: But if you don't have time to rest, add a little water at a time, start with a teaspoon, to make a clump batter. The gram flour vegetable pakora batter should be thick but not too watery.
        </li>

        <h3>Cooking the Mixed Vegetable Pakora on the Stove</h3>
        <li>
            Step 4: Heat oil over medium flame in a pan or kadai. Test the oil by adding a small portion of the pakora; they should sizzle and come up immediately. Using a teaspoon, gently drop the pakoras into the hot oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 5: Fry over medium flame for 4-5 minutes, flipping on either side, until they turn golden and crisp.
        </li>
        <li>
            Step 6: Remove them with a slotted spoon and transfer to a kitchen tissue to absorb any excess oil.
        </li>
